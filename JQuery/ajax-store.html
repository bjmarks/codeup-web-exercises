<!-- 

Download and save ajax-store.html.
Create a data directory and download inventory.json to that folder.
Your online tool store should load data from the JSON file using a get request and append the data to the table. You will need to use either $.ajax() or $.get(), and a .done() callback.
Add some new entries to inventory.json and see how the data on the page gets updated.
Add a "Refresh" button that will load inventory.json for you without having to refresh the entire page.
Add Twitter Bootstrap to your online store with some custom CSS to make the style your own.
Ajax Blog

Create a new html file called ajax-blog.html.
At minimum, your Ajax blog will need an empty <div> with an id of posts.
Add your own Bootstrap theme to this file as well. Feel free to use the same one as your store or choose a different one.
Download blog.json to your data directory from before.
Use Ajax to load the contents of blog.json and add the data from it to your #posts div.
Add additional entries to blog.json and make sure your changes are reflected on the page.
