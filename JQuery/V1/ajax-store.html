Ajax Request

Ajax is a way to communicate with a server, sending or retrieving data, without refreshing the current webpage. Once the request is done we can alter the DOM with the requested information or result. The quintessential example of this is Google Maps. Each time you drag the map or press a button, the map information is changed without refreshing the entire view. This can provide a very rich user experience.

In this lesson we will learn how to use jQuery to send Ajax requests, and how to work with information returned from Ajax requests.

Basic Request

The syntax to perform an Ajax request in plain JavaScript can be rather challenging. To save ourselves from that complexity, we will be using jQuery to issue Ajax requests. The simplest way to issue an Ajax request is the following:


$.ajax("/some-url")
This will issue a GET request to your server, asking for the file stored at /some-url. What if we needed to use a POST request instead? Or if we wanted to pass some additional data with the request? For these purposes, and others, $.ajax() accepts a JavaScript object of additional options as a second argument.

Ajax Options

The easiest way to manipulate the Ajax options is to pass a JavaScript object like the following:


$.ajax("/some-url", {
    type: "POST",
    data: {
        name:     "John",
        location: "Boston"
    }
});
In this example, we are instructing jQuery to send a POST request rather than GET and to pass some additional information to the server with the request (name: John, location: Boston). The Ajax options object has numerous parameters and values it can use. Some of the most common options are:

type — The type of HTTP request to send to the server. Can be "GET", "POST", "PUT", or "DELETE". The default is "GET".
data — Data to be included with the request. Typically this will be a JavaScript object. If the request type is GET the data will be encoded into the URL being requested. Otherwise, it is included with the request behind the scenes.
dataType — The type of data we expect the server to send back from our request. Common options are "json", "xml", "html", or "text". By default, jQuery will try to guess this value based on the response content.
url — Rather than passing the request URL as a string to $.ajax() you can just pass a JavaScript object on its own and include the url option to specify where to send the request. We will see an example of this further on.
username & password — If a server requires a username and password you can specify it using these parameters.
headers — an object of whose key value pairs represent custom HTTP headers to send along with the request
Handling Responses

Now that we can send requests to the server, how do we handle the data that comes back? It is important to be aware that Ajax requests are done asynchronously. This means that even though the request is fired off when we call $.ajax(), JavaScript does not sit and wait for the response to come back. The server could reply in a fraction of a second, or it could reply in half a minute!

It is tempting to think we can write something along the lines of:


// THIS WILL *NOT* WORK

// Send Ajax request
var ajaxData = $.ajax("/some-url");
// Handle data from Ajax request
doSomething(ajaxData);
But just because an Ajax request has been sent is no guarantee that it has come back from the server by the time the next line of JavaScript is executed. In our example above, doSomething will be called before JavaScript has even finished sending the request to the server! Instead, we must explicitly specify a function to be called once the response has come back.
The example below makes a GET request to the pokeAPI using the /pokemon endpoint for data regarding Charmander.


$.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/charmander').done(function(data) {
    console.log(data);
})
A function that we create to be called when some process completes is called a callback function. The primary way to attach a callback to your Ajax request is to tack .done() to the end of your request and pass your callback to it, like the following:


$.ajax("/some-url").done(function(data, status, jqXhr) {
    alert("AJAX call completed successfully!");
    console.log("Request status: " + status);
    console.log("Data returned from server:");
    console.log(data);
});
.done() is a method that accepts a callback function as an argument. jQuery will then call that function once the Ajax request has come back successfully. The callback function, when called, will be passed 3 arguments:

data: the body of the response from the server
status: a string indicating the status of the request
jqXhr: a jQuery object that represents the Ajax request
jQuery tries to guess at the data type sent by the server; if jQuery thinks the server returned a JSON object, the argument will be an object. If jQuery thinks it was text, the argument will be a string. You can force a particular data type with the dataType option.

Remember that we can omit any parameters that we are not going to use from a function. Commonly, we will only need the data parameter.

There are three different methods you can use to specify callback functions for an Ajax request. They are:

.done — Takes in a function that is called when the request completes successfully.
.fail — Takes in a function that is called when a request completed with an error (e.g. the server sent back a 404).
.always — Takes in a function that is called for both failed and successful requests.
The function passed to .fail will be called with 3 arguments:

jqXhr — a jQuery object that represents the Ajax request
status — a string representing the status of the request
error — an object that represents the error that occurred, if any
The callback function attached with .always will be called with the same arguments the were passed to either the .done callback, or the .fail callback, depending on whether the request was successful or not.

An example combining all three callback types might look like:


$.ajax("/some-url").done(function(data, status, jqXhr) {
    alert("Everything went great! Check out the server's response in the console.");
    console.log(data);
}).fail(function(jqXhr, status, error) {
    alert("There was an error! Check the console for details");
    console.log("Response status: " + status);
    console.log("Error object: " + error);
}).always(function() {
    alert("This function always runs!");
});
Notice that only two of those callbacks will ever be called; .done() and .fail() are mutually exclusive, so there should never be a case where both are called. .always(), as the name implies, is always called.

If for whatever reason you need to break your callbacks apart, or if the syntax is feeling too dense, you can assign your Ajax request to a variable and then attach callbacks to that variable. Our above example could be rewritten as:


// Assign to variable
var jqXhr = $.ajax("/some-url");

// Attach callback functions individually
jqXhr.done(function(data, status, jqXhr) {
    alert("Everything went great!");
});

jqXhr.fail(function(jqXhr, status, error) {
    alert("There was an error!");
});

jqXhr.always(function() {
    alert("And we're done!");
});
Remember that any anonymous function can be replaced with a named function, and as our code starts to get more complex, it usually makes sense to do so. Here is a small example using named functions with comments that contain examples of what the function might be used for:


function onSuccess(data, status, jqXhr) {
    // display the requested data to the user
}

function onFail(jqXhr, status, error) {
    // tell the user something went wrong, and to try again later
}

function stopLoadingAnimation() {
    // the request is no longer pending, hide the loading spinner
}

$.ajax("/some-url")
    .done(onSuccess)
    .fail(onFail)
    .always(stopLoadingAnimation);
Get & Post Shorthand

jQuery includes a couple of shortcuts for relatively simple requests. Often, we simply want to send either a GET or POST request with some simple parameters. For example, if you wanted to send a GET request to /users with the parameters limit: 10 and offset: 20 you can use the .get method like so:


$.get("/users", {
    limit:  10,
    offset: 20
}).done(function(data) {
    // do something with the data
});
The first argument is the URL we are requesting, like before. The second argument is whatever data we want to send. The above example would be the same as:


$.ajax({
    url: "/users",
    type: "GET",
    data: {
        limit:  10,
        offset: 20
    }
}).done(function(data) {
    // do something with the data
});
Both examples are identical, it is just a matter of which syntax you find most comfortable. The same is true of $.post(). If we wanted to send a POST request to /address/save with the data of first_name: George, last_name: Weathers, city: Denver, state: CO we could do:


$.post("/address/save", {
    first_name: "George",
    last_name:  "Weathers",
    city:       "Denver",
    state:      "CO"
}).done(function(data) {
    // do something with the response
});

Ajax Store

Download and save ajax-store.html.
Create a data directory and download inventory.json to that folder.
Your online tool store should load data from the JSON file using a get request and append the data to the table. You will need to use either $.ajax() or $.get(), and a .done() callback.
Add some new entries to inventory.json and see how the data on the page gets updated.
Add a "Refresh" button that will load inventory.json for you without having to refresh the entire page.
Add Twitter Bootstrap to your online store with some custom CSS to make the style your own.
