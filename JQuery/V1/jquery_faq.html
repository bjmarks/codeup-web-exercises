<!-- 
Create a new file named jquery_faq.html. Commit all changes to GitHub.
In a HTML structure, create a definition list containing 10 FAQs about national parks.
Add a class to all dd elements named invisible.
Create some CSS rules that sets elements with the invisible class to visibility: hidden;.
Update the page with jQuery to add a link that toggles the class invisible on and off for all dd elements.

Bonus
When any of the dt elements is clicked, the element that was clicked should be highlighted. 


Exercises
Open the file named jquery_faq.html for editing. Commit all changes to GitHub.
Under the FAQ, add 3 unordered lists like above. Each list should contain a national park name in an h3 element, and a ul of 4 facts about the park.
Create a button that, when clicked, makes the last li in each ul have a yellow background.
When any h3 is clicked, the lis underneath it should be bolded. Use font-weight: bold to achieve this.
When any list item is clicked, first li of the parent ul should have a font color of blue.

Bonus
Create 3 divs that each look like a picture frame. Each one should have a unique background image and a button underneath that swaps the image from the frame. Use the traversing functions of jQuery to accomplish this.
The rules are the following:
The left frame swaps to the right and takes the image from the frame in the center.
The center frame swaps randomly to either the left or right.
The right frame swaps to the left and takes the image from the frame in the center.
