<!-- 
Create a new html file called ajax-blog.html.
At minimum, your Ajax blog will need an empty <div> with an id of posts.
Add your own Bootstrap theme to this file as well. Feel free to use the same one as your store or choose a different one.
Download blog.json to your data directory from before.
Use Ajax to load the contents of blog.json and add the data from it to your #posts div.
Add additional entries to blog.json and make sure your changes are reflected on the page.
