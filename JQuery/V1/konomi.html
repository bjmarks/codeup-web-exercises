Keyboard Events

jQuery events include keyboard events like a key being pressed or when a key is up or down.

In this lesson we will be learning about these jQuery methods:

.keydown() — Bind an event handler to the "keydown" JavaScript event or trigger that event on an element.
.keypress() — Bind an event handler to the "keypress" JavaScript event or trigger that event on an element.
.keyup() — Bind an event handler to the "keyup" JavaScript event or trigger that event on an element.
as well as the .on() method, which allows us to listen for any arbitrary event, and the .off() method, which removes event listeners.

.keydown()

The syntax for using .keydown() is:


$( selector ).keydown( handler )
We can use the .keydown() event handler in the same way we do a click.


<p>Please type something into this form:</p>
<form>
    <input type="text" id="textfield" name="textfield" placeholder="Type Here"/>
</form>

$('#textfield').keydown(function() {
    alert('A key was pushed down!');
});
JS Bin Example

.keypress()

Keypress is the same as keydown, with one small exception: modifier keys (shift, control, escape, etc) being pressed will trigger the keydown event, but will not trigger keypress events.

.keyup()

The keyup event is very similar to the keydown event, except keyup will trigger an event when a key is released.

The syntax is the same as .keydown():


$( selector ).keyup( handler(eventObject) )
Simply changing out the .keydown() method with the .keyup() method alters the behavior:


<p>Please type something into this form:<\p>
<form>
    <input type="text" id="textfield" name="textfield" placeholder="Type Here"/>
</form>

$('#textfield').keyup(function() {
    alert('a key was released!');
});
JS Bin Example

.on()

All the jQuery events we have covered so far can also be listened to using the .on() method. This method takes the event listener type and a callback function.

To use a keyboard event, like keydown the syntax would be:


.on('keydown', function() {});
We can use any of the events we have covered thus far as the first argument to .on.

.off()

The .off method removes event listeners from a specified element or elements. We can use it to remove event listeners for a specific event or all the event listeners.

Remove any handlers for the click event from all elements with the class clickable


$('.clickable').off('click');
Remove all event handlers from all paragraph tags


$('p').off();

Exercises

The Konami Code was a cheat code that appeared on a number of games from Konami. Contra was one of the early NES games to have featured the Konami Code. Contra would start you with 3 lives per game, but after the start screen, if you entered the Konami Code, you would get 30 lives!

The Konami Code: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A ( ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A )

Create a file named konami.html using the template below. This code will log a number reference that is tied to each key that is entered on your keyboard. Open the console and view the output as you type on the keyboard.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Konami Code</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Konami Code</h1>

    <script src="/js/jquery.js"></script>
    <script>
        "use strict";

        $(document).keyup(function(event){
            console.log(event.keyCode);
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
Allow the user to enter the Konami Code: "↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → b a enter" (the return key)
Find the matching sequence using the code above for each key in the Konami Code.
Don't worry about capital a or b just check for lowercase.
After the correct Konami Code sequence is inputted, have the script alert the user: "You have added 30 lives! Other ideas:
Change the background screen.
Play a sound.
Be creative!
Happy Playing. -->
