Create a button that, when clicked, makes the last li in each ul have a yellow background.
When any h3 is clicked, the lis underneath it should be bolded. Use font-weight: bold to achieve this.
When any list item is clicked, first li of the parent ul should have a font color of blue.

Create 3 divs that each look like a picture frame. Each one should have a unique background image and a button underneath that swaps the image from the frame.
Use the traversing functions of jQuery to accomplish this. The rules are the following:
The left frame swaps to the right and takes the image from the frame in the center.
The center frame swaps randomly to either the left or right.
The right frame swaps to the left and takes the image from the frame in the center.
