// Create a function that accepts a GitHub username, and returns a promise that resolves returning just the date of the last commit that user made. Reference the github api documentation to achieve this.

// Create Your Own Promise

// Write a function named wait that accepts a number as a parameter, and returns a promise that resolves after the passed number of milliseconds.


// wait(1000).then(() => console.log('You\'ll see this after 1 second'));
// wait(3000).then(() => console.log('You\'ll see this after 3 seconds'));
// 1. As a bonus make sure the promise resolves with the milliseconds in return, so you can make the console log message more dynamic.
